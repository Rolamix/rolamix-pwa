1. Flexbox - https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs
  We are using Flexbox but this means we are exposed to the buggy implementation in IE11 and Safari 10.
  To that end, you must follow the following rules when using Flexbox:

  * Use min/max height/width sparingly. Safari 10 only recognizes the `flex: x` value for sizing on lines.
    If you need to use one of these, apply it to an inner container of the element.
  * IE11 requires flex-basis to have a unit - do not declare as "1 0 0", use "1 0 0%" (not px).
  * In IE11, containers with display: flex and flex-direction: column will not properly
    calculate their flexed childrens' sizes if the container has min-height but no explicit height property.
  * IE 11 does not vertically align items correctly when min-height is used
  * Safari <= 10.1, non-flex children of flexed containers cannot have % heights

2. Importing node_modules css/sass files:
  * @import "~node_modules/path/to/file" (without the file extension);

3. Be very, very careful about the Ionic controls you use. Some are not SSR-safe (like ion-app).
  Some come as part of larger bundles with other components you will NOT use, wasting bandwidth.
  In such cases, better to rebuild the components ourselves. For example, ion-button comes
  packaged in the same bundle as ion-app: so even if you don't use it, you've got it and all its
  dependencies in the same bundle.
